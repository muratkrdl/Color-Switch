# Color-Switch

You play as a small circle, which is 1 of 4 colours: blue, purple, yellow, or pink.

The goal is to tap the screen, which will make the circle move up.

Ahead of you are obstacles that move, rotate, and change in challenging ways that are coloured the same. Your goal is to move through the obstacles, but you are only able to pass through the colour that your circle resembles.

After you pass one obstacle, your colour will change.
